Developer documentation for the [Groundhog](https://groundhog.dev) L1 blockchain. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) + [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).

## Development

```bash
pnpm install       # Install dependencies
pnpm dev           # Dev server at localhost:4321
pnpm build         # Production build to dist/
pnpm preview       # Preview production build locally
```

1. Create a `.md` file in the appropriate `src/content/docs/<section>/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with `title` and `description`
3. Add the slug to the sidebar array in `astro.config.mjs`
4. Run `pnpm build` to verify
