title: Wallet Integration Status
description: Current signer APIs and the support boundary for browser-wallet integration.
---

No official browser-wallet provider or adapter is published yet. The current supported user flow is the Groundhog CLI: it creates a key-owned contract wallet, resolves network-specific wallet entrypoints, wraps application calls in the wallet's `do_action` invocation, signs, and submits them.

This page was source-checked against published `@groundhogchain/client` `0.1.6` and Groundhog CLI `0.6.3` on August 5, 2026.

See [Develop on Devnet with the CLI](/tutorials/develop-on-devnet/) for that end-to-end flow.

## Current TypeScript Extension Point

`@groundhogchain/client` exports a generic signer interface for integrating a wallet, hardware signer, remote signer, or custom key manager:

```typescript
import type { PublicKey, Signature } from "@groundhogchain/protocol";

export interface Signer {
  sign(message: Uint8Array): Promise<Signature>;
  publicKey: PublicKey;
}
```

Implementing `Signer` only supplies signatures over canonical transaction bytes. It does not provide:

- Browser connection or account-selection UX
- Permission prompts
- Network discovery
- Wallet creation or recovery
- Construction of the wallet contract's root `do_action` invocation
- Mapping a public key to its deployed contract-wallet address

## Transaction Shape

Groundhog authorization is rooted at the transaction's invoked address. For normal users, that root address is the user's contract wallet. A generated application invocation is encoded as an inner invocation and passed to the wallet's `do_action` entrypoint.

The current CLI resolves wallet entrypoints from the active local runtime manifest or hosted `/v1/network` descriptor. Wallet integrations should do the same rather than hard-coding entrypoint IDs.

:::caution[TypeScript support boundary]
Published client `0.1.6` provides low-level transaction, submission, and signer primitives, but it does not provide the descriptor-driven wallet transaction builder used by the CLI. Do not submit a generated target-contract invocation as the root transaction and assume the wallet will authorize it.
:::

Until the wallet builder and browser adapter are published, use the CLI for state-changing calls and the [TypeScript SDK](/tools/typescript-sdk/) for supported reads and views.

## Planned Integration Surface

A complete browser-wallet integration will need a published contract between the app and wallet for:

- Connecting and selecting accounts
- Reporting network identity and wallet address
- Reviewing the inner application invocation
- Building or validating the wallet-root invocation
- Signing canonical transaction bytes
- Returning submission results and user-facing errors

This page will become an implementation guide when that adapter and protocol are available.
