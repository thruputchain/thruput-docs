title: Invocation Frames
description: Execution context, call stack management, and frame lifecycle.
---

An **Invocation Frame** represents the execution context for a single [contract](/how-it-works/contracts/) method call. A new frame is created:
- When a transaction first starts (the root frame)
- Whenever a contract invokes another contract via the Invoke [syscall](/reference/syscalls/) (a child frame), also known as a [cross-contract call](/reference/cross-contract-calls/)

Each frame tracks the execution state, resource usage, and state modifications for one contract method invocation.
Frames are independent of artifact type. The default user contract runtime is RV32, Groundhog's 32-bit RISC-V target, but the same frame model also covers native contracts, test mocks, and legacy WASM contracts.

## Frame Structure

An invocation frame contains the following data (pseudocode):

```rust
// Pseudocode - not actual implementation
struct InvocationFrame {
    // Immutable context (set at frame creation)
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    entrypoint: ContractEntrypointID,     // 8-byte method identifier
    calldata: Vec<u8>,                      // Encoded arguments
    invocation_flags: InvocationFlagSet,  // Behavioral modifiers (e.g., try_invoke, read_only)
                                          // Root frame has no flags set
    max_gas: GasAmount,                   // Capped at parent's remaining gas

    // Mutable state (modified during execution)
    most_recent_child_result: Option<ChildResultState>,  // Result from last child invocation
    deployed_contracts: Vec<(ContractAddress, DeployedContractHash)>,  // Deployments in this frame + committed children
    state_changes: HashMap<AddressAndKey, StorageDelta>,  // Ledger modifications from this frame + committed children
    events: Vec<Event>,  // Events emitted in this frame + committed children
    gas_used: GasAmount,  // Gas consumed so far
}

struct ChildResultState {
    buffer: Vec<u8>,           // Return data from child (empty if **Fault**)
    status: InvocationFrameStatusCode, // **Return**, **Abort**, or **Fault**
}

enum InvocationFrameStatusCode {
    Return = 0,   // Child returned successfully (preserves state)
    Fault  = 1,   // Child hit a **Fault** (discards state)
    Abort  = 2,   // Child **Aborted** (discards state, but returns data)
}

// State changes can be writes, deletes, or other operations
enum StateChange {
    Write_Bytestring(Bytes),
    // Other state operations...
}

type AddressAndKey = (ContractAddress, StorageKey);
```

**Notes:**
- The root frame has no invocation flags set
- Contracts manipulate mutable state via [system calls](/reference/syscalls/)

## Call Stack

Invocation frames are organized as a stack. When a contract invokes another contract, a new frame is pushed onto the stack. When the subinvocation completes, its frame is popped and control returns to the caller.

**Example stack:**
```
[Root Frame]
  contract: contract_a_address
  entrypoint: 0x1111111111111111

  [Child Frame]
    contract: contract_b_address
    entrypoint: 0x2222222222222222

    [Nested Child Frame]
      contract: contract_c_address
      entrypoint: 0x3333333333333333
```

## Frame Lifecycle

Each invocation frame progresses through five stages:

### 1. Creation

A new frame is created when:
- A transaction begins (root frame)
- A contract calls the Invoke [syscall](/reference/syscalls/) (child frame)

The frame is initialized with:
- Immutable context: contract address, entrypoint ID, calldata, invocation flags, max gas
- Empty mutable state: no child returns, no deployments, no state changes, no events, zero gas used

**Note:** Gas allocated to a child frame is capped at the parent's remaining gas. The root frame has no invocation flags set.

### 2. Execution

The contract executes in its runtime, RV32 by default, making syscalls to read and write ledger state.
All modifications are recorded in the frame's mutable state.

### 3. Completion

A frame terminates in one of three ways:[^termination-syscall]

**a) Fault**

The frame terminates abnormally due to:
- Runtime trap, such as an invalid instruction, bad program counter, bad memory access, breakpoint, or equivalent deterministic guest failure
- Out of gas

When a frame **Faults**: No return buffer, all state changes discarded, gas still consumed

**b) Return**

The contract completes successfully, preserving its state changes.

When a frame **Returns**: Return buffer (may be empty) passed to caller, state changes preserved, gas consumed

**c) Abort**

The contract explicitly aborts its execution, discarding state changes but returning data to the caller.

When a frame **Aborts**: Return buffer passed to caller, state changes discarded, gas consumed

[^termination-syscall]: Contracts normally control termination through the Return syscall, which takes an output buffer and a `revert_frame` flag (`false` for Return, `true` for Abort). SDK-generated RV32 entrypoint wrappers use this path. A missing RV32 entrypoint or a wrapper that falls through traps deterministically. The status codes used on this page (`Return = 0`, `Fault = 1`, `Abort = 2`) match `InvocationFrameStatusCode` in `protocol/transaction.x`.

### 4. Merge into Parent (or Finalize for Root)

**For child frames:**

The parent frame is updated:
- Gas: Parent's `gas_used` increases by child's `gas_used`
- Result state: Parent's `most_recent_child_result` is set to child's result
  - If child hit a **Fault**: status = Fault, buffer = empty
  - If child **Returned**: status = Return, buffer = child's return buffer
  - If child **Aborted**: status = Abort, buffer = child's return buffer

State changes:
- If child **Returned**: Parent merges child's `state_changes`, `deployed_contracts`, and `events` into its own
  - Child writes overwrite parent writes on the same `(ContractAddress, StorageKey)` pair
  - This ensures each frame has at most one delta per storage key
  - Child events are appended to parent's event list
- If child **Aborted or hit a Fault**: Child's state changes, deployments, and events are discarded

**For root frame:**

The transaction terminates. The root frame's `state_changes` map is passed to the conflict checking and commit protocol (see [Transaction Lifecycle](/how-it-works/transaction-lifecycle/)).

### 5. Pop and Return

The frame is removed from the call stack:
- Control returns to the caller (or transaction ends if root frame)
- **All guest execution state is discarded** (memory, registers, stack, program counter)

**WARNING:** Guest memory does not persist across invocation frames. Any data not written to ledger storage is lost when the frame terminates.

## Example: Nested Contract Calls

This example shows a transaction invoking contract A, which calls contracts B, C, and D. The three different frame termination states (**Fault**, **Return**, **Abort**) are demonstrated.

**1. Root frame - ContractA.method() created**

Immutable context:
```
contract: contract_a_address
entrypoint: 0x1111111111111111
calldata: <empty>
flags: (none - root frame has no flags)
max_gas: 1_000_000
```

Initial mutable state:
```
most_recent_child_result: (none)
deployed_contracts: []
state_changes: {}
gas_used: 0
```

**2. ContractA writes to storage**

ContractA executes a storage write:
```
state_changes: {
  (contract_a_address, key_0x01): Write_Bytestring('AAA')
}
gas_used: 10_000
```

**3. ContractA calls ContractB - Push new frame**

ContractB frame immutable context:
```
contract: contract_b_address
entrypoint: 0x2222222222222222
calldata: <empty>
flags: (none)
max_gas: 500_000  // allocated from ContractA's remaining gas
```

ContractB executes and writes to storage:
```
state_changes: {
  (contract_b_address, key_0x02): Write_Bytestring('BBB')
}
gas_used: 15_000
```

**4. ContractB Returns (preserves state changes)**

ContractB completes successfully, preserving its state:
```
return_buffer: "success_b"
status: Return
```

ContractA frame updated after ContractB Returns:
```
most_recent_child_result: { buffer: "success_b", status: Return }
deployed_contracts: []
state_changes: {
  (contract_a_address, key_0x01): Write_Bytestring('AAA'),
  (contract_b_address, key_0x02): Write_Bytestring('BBB')
}  // ContractB's changes merged into parent
gas_used: 25_000  // 10_000 from A + 15_000 from B
```

**5. ContractA calls ContractC - Push new frame**

ContractC frame immutable context:
```
contract: contract_c_address
entrypoint: 0x3333333333333333
calldata: <empty>
flags: (none)
max_gas: 475_000  // remaining gas from ContractA
```

ContractC executes and writes to storage:
```
state_changes: {
  (contract_c_address, key_0x03): Write_Bytestring('CCC')
}
gas_used: 20_000
```

**6. ContractC Aborts (discards state)**

ContractC explicitly aborts, discarding its state changes:
```
return_buffer: "error_c"
status: Abort
```

ContractA frame updated after ContractC Aborts:
```
most_recent_child_result: { buffer: "error_c", status: Abort }
deployed_contracts: []
state_changes: {
  (contract_a_address, key_0x01): Write_Bytestring('AAA'),
  (contract_b_address, key_0x02): Write_Bytestring('BBB')
}  // ContractC's changes DISCARDED (aborted)
gas_used: 45_000  // gas still consumed
```

**7. ContractA calls ContractD - Push new frame**

ContractD frame immutable context:
```
contract: contract_d_address
entrypoint: 0x4444444444444444
calldata: <empty>
flags: (none)
max_gas: 455_000
```

ContractD writes to storage:
```
state_changes: {
  (contract_d_address, key_0x04): Write_Bytestring('DDD')
}
gas_used: 10_000
```

**8. ContractD hits a Fault (unhandled error)**

ContractD hits a runtime trap, such as bad memory access, an invalid instruction, or a breakpoint:
```
status: Fault
No return buffer
All state changes discarded
```

ContractA frame updated after ContractD hits a Fault:
```
most_recent_child_result: { buffer: <empty>, status: Fault }
deployed_contracts: []
state_changes: {
  (contract_a_address, key_0x01): Write_Bytestring('AAA'),
  (contract_b_address, key_0x02): Write_Bytestring('BBB')
}  // ContractD's changes DISCARDED (hit a Fault)
gas_used: 55_000  // gas still consumed
```

**9. ContractA makes final storage write**

ContractA writes one more value:
```
state_changes: {
  (contract_a_address, key_0x01): Write_Bytestring('AAA'),
  (contract_b_address, key_0x02): Write_Bytestring('BBB'),
  (contract_a_address, key_0x05): Write_Bytestring('FINAL')
}
gas_used: 60_000
```

**10. Root frame Returns (commits transaction)**

ContractA completes successfully, committing the transaction:
```
return_buffer: "done"
status: Return
deployed_contracts: []
state_changes: {
  (contract_a_address, key_0x01): Write_Bytestring('AAA'),
  (contract_b_address, key_0x02): Write_Bytestring('BBB'),
  (contract_a_address, key_0x05): Write_Bytestring('FINAL')
}
```

**11. Reservation and commit**
- The root frame's `state_changes` map is used for reservation and commit
- Each delta is reserved against the block's accumulated state
- If all reservations succeed, all writes commit atomically to the ledger
- Final ledger state includes AAA, BBB, and FINAL
- CCC and DDD were never committed (ContractC Aborted, ContractD hit a Fault)
