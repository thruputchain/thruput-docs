description: Groundhog concepts for Solana and Anchor developers.
---

This guide is for developers who know Solana and Anchor. It uses familiar Solana concepts to explain how Groundhog works, what changes, and what you stop worrying about.

For the foundational concepts (delta operations, commutativity, storage types), see [For Blockchain Developers](/start/for-blockchain-developers/). This page builds on that with Solana-specific patterns.

## Accounts vs. Storage

This is the biggest mental model shift. On Solana, state lives in accounts. Each account is a separate object with its own address, lamport balance, owner program, and serialized data. Your program receives an array of accounts, validates them, deserializes them, operates on them, and serializes them back. Anchor's `#[derive(Accounts)]` automates the validation, but the account array is always there.

Groundhog does not use Solana's caller-supplied account-array model. State lives under contract addresses in typed storage fields. A token contract doesn't receive "the sender's balance account" and "the receiver's balance account" as separate objects. It has a `Map<ContractAddress, Balance>` field called `balances`, and it reads and writes entries in that map.

**Solana (Anchor):**

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Transfer<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub from: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub to: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
}
```

**Groundhog:**

```rust
#[sdk::storage]
pub struct Token {
    balances: Map<ContractAddress, Balance>,
}

fn transfer(&mut self, receiver: &ContractAddress, amount: Amount) {
    let caller = get_caller();
    self.balances.at_mut(&caller).decrease(amount);
    self.balances.at_mut(receiver).lazy_increase(amount);
}
```

No account array. No account validation. No deserialization step. The `Map` is the state, and the method operates on it directly.

## Access Lists vs. Type-Based Parallelism

On Solana, you declare every account a transaction will touch before the transaction runs. The runtime uses this manifest to schedule parallel execution: transactions that don't share writable accounts can run concurrently. This is why you build the account array. It's not just for validation. It's how Solana knows what can parallelize.

On Groundhog, you declare nothing. The storage types themselves determine what parallelizes. `Balance` increases and decreases use mergeable deltas. `Map` operations on different keys never interact. The runtime doesn't need a manifest because the types carry the parallelism rules.

This is a fundamental difference. On Solana, scheduling depends on the accounts and mutability declared by the transaction, and Anchor validates those accounts before instruction logic runs. On Groundhog, the runtime discovers storage access during execution and applies the merge rules of each storage type.

## The Contract Lifecycle

Both platforms separate contract code from address-specific state, and both compile Rust to a deployable binary format: SBF on Solana and RV32 on Groundhog. A Groundhog transaction can attach code and invoke `DeployContract` in the same transaction.

### Writing

Solana programs are written in Rust with Anchor (or native). Groundhog contracts are also Rust, with a different SDK. The macro system has a similar role but different surface area:

| Anchor | Groundhog SDK | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `#[program]` | `#[contract]` | Marks the implementation block |
| `#[derive(Accounts)]` | *(not needed)* | Account validation. Groundhog has no account arrays. |
| `#[account]` | `#[sdk::storage]` | Marks state structure |
| `#[instruction]` | Method parameters | Instruction data. Groundhog methods take typed parameters directly. |
| `init` constraint | Ordinary initialization method | Groundhog deployment does not invoke it automatically. |

### Compiling

Solana compiles programs for SBF (`cargo build-sbf`). Groundhog compiles to RV32, a 32-bit RISC-V target, by default:

```bash
groundhog build
```

### Deploying

On Solana, you upload the program binary, then initialize accounts for it. On Groundhog, you deploy the RV32 artifact and create a contract instance via `DeployContract` with a nonce. The contract address is deterministically derived from the deployer's address, the contract hash, and the nonce. Similar to Solana PDAs in predictability, but simpler: no seeds, no bump bytes.

### Calling

On Solana, a transaction contains instructions, each specifying a program ID, account array, and serialized instruction data. On Groundhog, a transaction specifies a contract address, an entrypoint ID, and XDR-encoded arguments. No account array needed.

The SDK generates typed clients:

```rust
let client = TokenClient::new(&token_addr);
client.transfer(&recipient, 100);
```

## Mental Model Shifts

| Solana / Anchor | Groundhog | Why |
|-----------------|-----------|-----|
| Accounts with serialized data | Typed storage fields (`Map`, `Balance`, `NNInt`) | State lives inside the contract. No external accounts. |
| `#[derive(Accounts)]` validation | Nothing. Types handle it. | No access list to declare or validate. |
| PDAs (seeds + bump) | Deterministic address (deployer + nonce + hash) | Simpler derivation. No seed discovery. |
| Rent-exempt account funding | HOG deposit (refundable) | Hold tokens for storage capacity. No rent clock. |
| Per-transaction compute budget | Gas limits exist but cost zero | Metering bounds computation. No tokens burned. Hold HOG for throughput capacity. |
| CPI (cross-program invocation) | Cross-contract calls | Same concept, simpler API, snapshot isolation. |
| `Signer<'info>` propagation | `get_caller()` | Caller identity. No signer array to thread through CPIs. |
| `balance -= amount; balance += amount` | `decrease(amount); lazy_increase(amount)` | Deltas merge in parallel. Assignments conflict. |
| Account-level write locks | Type-level guarantees | The type (`Balance`, `Map`, `Bytestring`) enforces correctness; concurrency follows from that. |

## What Disappears

### Account Arrays and Validation

Every Solana transaction starts by building the right account array. Wrong order, missing account, wrong mutability flag: transaction fails. Anchor automates some of this, but you still think in terms of "which accounts does this instruction need?"

Groundhog has no account concept. Your contract method takes typed parameters (an address, an amount) and operates on its own storage. No account discovery, no validation boilerplate, no "account not found" errors.

### Rent and Account Lifecycle

Solana accounts must hold a minimum lamport balance (the rent-exempt minimum, originally calculated against a rent schedule and now required at creation since rent collection was deprecated). This creates friction: every new piece of state costs lamports upfront, and you need to calculate the minimum balance for your account size.

Groundhog uses a capital deposit model for storage. You hold HOG tokens as a deposit while storage is allocated, and the deposit is refundable when storage is freed. No rent clock, no garbage collection, no minimum balance calculations.

### Compute Unit Budgets

Solana transactions have a compute budget that can be adjusted per transaction through compute-budget instructions. Programs must fit within that resource budget, including the work performed by CPIs.

Groundhog has gas limits that meter computation, but gas costs zero tokens. Specify a gas limit to bound execution, but don't optimize for gas cost. There are no priority fees and no fee-related failures.

### PDA Seed Management

PDAs on Solana require choosing seeds and deriving an off-curve address with a bump. Anchor's `seeds` and `bump` constraints validate that derivation.

Groundhog contract addresses are derived from deployer + nonce + contract hash. One derivation, deterministic, no bumps. If your Solana program uses PDAs as state accounts (one per user, one per pool), the Groundhog equivalent is a `Map<Key, Value>` field in your contract storage. The map entries replace the PDAs.

### Signer Propagation in CPIs

On Solana, cross-program invocations require passing signer seeds so the runtime can verify PDA authority. This is fiddly: wrong seeds, wrong program ID, missing signer. Debugging CPI signer failures is a common pain point.

Groundhog cross-contract calls don't propagate signers. The called contract sees `get_caller()` returning the calling contract's address. Authorization is the called contract's responsibility, checked against its own storage. No signer arrays, no PDA signing.

## Pattern Adaptations

### PDA State Accounts → Map Fields

**Solana pattern:** create a PDA account per user to store their state.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateUserAccount<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = user,
        space = 8 + UserState::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [b"user", user.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]
    pub user_state: Account<'info, UserState>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

**Groundhog:** a Map field inside the contract. No separate account creation.

```rust
#[sdk::storage]
pub struct MyContract {
    user_states: Map<ContractAddress, Value<UserState>>,
}

fn get_user_state(&self, user: &ContractAddress) -> UserState {
    self.user_states
        .at(user)
        .try_get()
        .none_if_missing()
        .unwrap()
        .unwrap_or_default()
}
```

No `init` instruction, no `space` calculation, no `payer`, no `system_program`. The map entry is created on first write.

### Token Transfer

**Solana (SPL Token):**

```rust
let cpi_accounts = Transfer {
    from: ctx.accounts.from_token_account.to_account_info(),
    to: ctx.accounts.to_token_account.to_account_info(),
    authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
};
let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new(ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(), cpi_accounts);
token::transfer(cpi_ctx, amount)?;
```

**Groundhog:**

```rust
fn transfer(&mut self, receiver: &ContractAddress, amount: Amount) {
    let caller = get_caller();
    self.balances.at_mut(&caller).decrease(amount);
    self.balances.at_mut(receiver).lazy_increase(amount);
}
```

No CPI context, no account info conversion, no external token program. The balance is a map field in your contract. Both calls produce mergeable deltas. `decrease` loads and checks the sender during execution, while `lazy_increase` skips the receiver load and defers its bound check.

### Cross-Program Invocation → Cross-Contract Call

**Solana:**

```rust
let cpi_accounts = MintTo {
    mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),
    to: ctx.accounts.token_account.to_account_info(),
    authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
};
let seeds = &[b"mint_authority", &[bump]];
let signer_seeds = &[&seeds[..]];
let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new_with_signer(
    ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
    cpi_accounts,
    signer_seeds,
);
token::mint_to(cpi_ctx, amount)?;
```

**Groundhog:**

```rust
let token = ERC20Client::new(&token_addr);
token.mint(&recipient, amount);
```

The `#[contract]` macro generates the client. No account arrays, no signer seeds, no CPI context construction. The call executes within the same snapshot. If the called contract aborts, your contract aborts too (or use `try_mint` to handle the error).

### Error Handling

**Solana (Anchor):**

```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum MyError {
    #[msg("Not authorized")]
    NotAuthorized,
    #[msg("Insufficient balance")]
    InsufficientBalance,
}

// In handler:
require!(ctx.accounts.authority.key() == expected, MyError::NotAuthorized);
```

**Groundhog:**

```rust
#[contract_exception]
pub enum Error {
    NotAuthorized = 1,
}

// In method:
ensure(get_caller() == self.contract_owner.get(), Error::NotAuthorized);
```

Similar pattern: define error variants, check conditions. Anchor uses `require!` macro, Groundhog uses `ensure()`. Both abort the transaction on failure. The difference: Groundhog errors are XDR-serialized (for cross-contract error inspection), and `Balance::decrease` aborts automatically on underflow without a separate balance check.
