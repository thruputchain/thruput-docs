title: Build a Counter
description: "Tutorial: build a counter contract on Groundhog, step by step."
---

We're building a counter contract with initialize, increment, decrement, and get operations. It's the simplest possible Groundhog contract, but it demonstrates the core idea: express what you want to happen (`strict_inc`), not how to compute it. The system guarantees the result is correct, and as a bonus, concurrent operations execute in parallel.

**Prerequisites:** Complete the [Getting Started](/start/getting-started/) guide for SDK setup.

## What You'll Build

A contract with four methods:

| Method | Signature | What it does |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `initialize` | `(&mut self, initial_value: u64)` | Set starting value (runs once at deploy) |
| `increment` | `(&mut self, amount: u64)` | Add to the counter |
| `decrement` | `(&mut self, amount: u64)` | Subtract from the counter (aborts if result would be negative) |
| `get` | `(&self) -> u64` | Read current value |

## Step 1: Project Setup

Create a new contract crate in your workspace. Your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "counter"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true

[features]
dev = ["sdk/dev"]

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
doctest = false
test = false

[dependencies]
sdk = { workspace = true, features = ["storage"] }

[dev-dependencies]
counter = { path = ".", features = ["dev"] }
```

Your `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "dev"), no_std)]

sdk::declare_mock_contract!();

mod implementation;
pub use implementation::*;
```

The `no_std` attribute applies when not testing. Contracts compile to WASM, which has no standard library. The `dev` feature flag enables testing utilities (mock executor, contract mocking) that aren't included in the production build.

## Step 2: Define the Error Type

Every contract needs an error type. The `#[contract_exception]` macro generates the serialization derives and XDR encoding. Each variant maps to an integer discriminant.

```rust
use sdk::storage::NNInt;
use sdk::*;

#[contract_exception]
pub enum Error {
    NotAuthorized = 1,
}
```

This counter doesn't actually use authorization, so the `NotAuthorized` variant is a placeholder. The `#[contract]` macro requires the error type to exist. In a real contract, you'd add variants for your business logic errors. You don't need variants for SDK-level errors like NNInt underflow: those abort automatically.

## Step 3: Define Storage

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
#[sdk::storage]
pub struct Counter {
    value: NNInt,
}
```

The `#[sdk::storage]` macro generates serialization and persistence code. Each field becomes a storage slot. `NNInt` (non-negative integer) is the core commutative primitive: it supports additive operations that commute by construction.

One field is all this contract needs. More complex contracts use `Map<K, V>` for key-value storage (see [Build a Token](/tutorials/build-a-token/)).

## Step 4: Implement the Contract

```rust
#[contract(throws = Error)]
impl Counter {
    pub fn initialize(&mut self, initial_value: u64) {
        self.value.strict_inc(initial_value as i128);
    }

    pub fn increment(&mut self, amount: u64) {
        self.value.strict_inc(amount as i128);
    }

    pub fn decrement(&mut self, amount: u64) {
        self.value.strict_inc(-(amount as i128));
    }

    pub fn get(&self) -> u64 {
        self.value.try_get().unwrap_or(0) as u64
    }
}
```

Line by line:

- **`#[contract(throws = Error)]`** generates WASM exports for each public method and a `CounterClient` struct for cross-contract calls and testing. The client name defaults to `{StructName}Client`. You can override it with `client = CustomName` if needed.

- **`strict_inc(delta)`** is the only mutation operation. It records a delta ("+5", "-3") rather than an absolute value ("set to 10"). This is what makes operations commutative. Two concurrent `increment(5)` calls produce `+10`, regardless of execution order. `strict_inc` takes `i128`, so we cast the `u64` amount. For decrements, we negate the delta.

- **`strict_inc` aborts on underflow.** If the counter is at 3 and you call `decrement(5)`, the result would be -2, which violates the `NNInt` invariant. The transaction aborts automatically. You don't need to check for this.

- **`try_get().unwrap_or(0)`** reads the current value. `try_get()` returns `None` if the storage slot has never been written to, so `unwrap_or(0)` provides a default.

- **`&self` vs `&mut self`**: `get` takes `&self` (read-only), so it reads from the snapshot without producing any deltas. The other methods take `&mut self` and produce state changes.

## Step 5: Test It

Create `tests/test.rs`:

```rust
use counter::{register_mock_contract, CounterClient};
use sdk::*;

static NONCE: SHA256Hash = sdk::sha256_static!("COUNTER_NONCE");

#[test]
fn test_counter_basic() {
    let env = TestEnvironment::no_cost();
    let test_contract = register_mock_contract(&env);
    let contract_hash = test_contract.as_hash().clone();

    env.transact(|tx| {
        tx.call(&ContractAddress::named("test")).run(move || {
            let addr = deploy_contract(&NONCE, &contract_hash);
            let client = CounterClient::new(&addr);

            // Initialize with value 10
            client.initialize(10);
            assert_eq!(client.get(), 10);

            // Increment by 5
            client.increment(5);
            assert_eq!(client.get(), 15);

            // Decrement by 3
            client.decrement(3);
            assert_eq!(client.get(), 12);
        })
    })
    .assert_success();
}
```

Breaking down the test setup:

1. **`TestEnvironment::no_cost()`** creates a mock environment that skips storage cost enforcement. Good for logic tests.
2. **`register_mock_contract(&env)`** registers the contract with the test environment. This function is generated by `declare_mock_contract!()` in your `lib.rs` and available when the `dev` feature is enabled.
3. **`test_contract.as_hash().clone()`** gets the contract hash for deployment.
4. **`env.transact(...)`** runs the closure as a single auto-committed transaction. `tx.call(&ContractAddress::named("test"))` sets the address the transaction originates from; `.assert_success()` panics with details if the transaction did not commit. The returned `TransactResult` also records emitted events — see [Add Events to a Contract](/tutorials/add-events-to-a-contract/).
5. **`deploy_contract`** deploys the contract and returns its address. The nonce (`SHA256Hash`) makes the address deterministic across test runs.
6. **`CounterClient::new`** creates a typed client. Methods return values directly (no `Result` unwrapping needed).

### Testing Error Cases

Use `try_*` methods to verify that operations fail as expected:

```rust
use counter::{register_mock_contract, CounterClient, CounterClientError};

#[test]
fn test_counter_underflow() {
    let env = TestEnvironment::no_cost();
    let test_contract = register_mock_contract(&env);
    let contract_hash = test_contract.as_hash().clone();

    env.transact(|tx| {
        tx.call(&ContractAddress::named("test")).run(move || {
            let addr = deploy_contract(&NONCE, &contract_hash);
            let client = CounterClient::new(&addr);

            client.initialize(5);

            // Decrementing by 10 should abort: NNInt can't go negative
            match client.try_decrement(10) {
                Ok(_) => panic!("expected underflow"),
                Err(err) => assert!(
                    matches!(err, CounterClientError::Library(
                        LibraryExn::NonNegativeIntUnderflow
                    )),
                    "expected underflow, got: {err:?}"
                ),
            }
        })
    })
    .assert_success();
}
```

The `try_decrement` method (generated by the `#[contract]` macro alongside `decrement`) returns a `Result` instead of aborting. The error type is `CounterClientError`, which wraps the SDK's `LibraryExn` variants. For NNInt underflow, you match on `CounterClientError::Library(LibraryExn::NonNegativeIntUnderflow)`.

### Native vs WASM: Same Bug, Different Experience

Now try something. Replace the `try_decrement` call with a direct `client.decrement(10)` (no `try_`), and run it both ways:

**`cargo test`** (native): `.assert_success()` panics with a structured description of the abort (`expected success, got abort ...`). The `TransactResult` it's called on is inspectable: swap `.assert_success()` for `.assert_abort()` to make the test expect the failure, or use a `try_*` method as above to match on the error. You can set a breakpoint and step through the abort.

**`groundhog test`** (WASM mock executor): the test crashes.

```
running 1 test
test test_counter_basic ... FAILED

---- test_counter_basic stdout ----
thread 'test_counter_basic' panicked at:
the called contract aborted
```

Same operation, different outcome. `cargo test` surfaces the abort as a structured result you can assert on and inspect. `groundhog test` crashes, just like it would on-chain. A real contract that tries to drive an NNInt below zero doesn't get a nice error to match on. It gets excluded from the block.

This is why both test modes exist. Use `cargo test` when you're iterating on logic and want to inspect errors. Use `groundhog test` when you want to verify your contract behaves the way it will in production.

## Why This Matters

This counter is trivial, but the pattern scales. Every mutation is a delta operation. That means if 1,000 users call `increment(1)` in the same block, all 1,000 transactions execute in parallel and merge to produce `+1000`. No conflicts, no retries, no ordering dependency. This is the foundation of every Groundhog contract, from simple counters to full token systems.
